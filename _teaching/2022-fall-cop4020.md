In Fall of 2022, I followed Pete J. Dobbins to his next course and TA'ed for COP4020.
In this course, the students' primary responsibility is to implement a programming language of the instructor's design, although there are also exams.
While I took the course in the Spring semester of that year, I discovered my love of programming language design, so moving to it with my supervisor felt like a natural move.

Advising Students
======
Office hours in this course were dedicating to advising students about their keystone project.

Debugging Students' Code
======
In this course's office hours, TAs helped students debug the keystone project code if their issues were not relevant to student learning.
I helped students debug issues that mostly had to do with misunderstanding the Java programming language used in this project.
