In the Spring of 2023, I was completing my final requirements for graduation and enjoyed a shorter class schedule than previous semesters.
This enabled my to take two TA appointments, and in an unorthodox move, I assisted Dr. Jason Harrington at the UF Math Department with his
Introduction to Computational Mathematics course, MAD2502.
Below are just some of my responsibilities in this role:

Writing Homework Questions
======
The course's homeworks were submitted through an open source elearning platform called OpenMath.
In OpenMath, I wrote homework questions for the class using the platform's PHP framework for question coding.

Grading Exams
======
After each exam, as the sole TA, I was responsible for grading the students' submissions.
