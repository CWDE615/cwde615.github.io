In Spring of 2023, I continued as a TA for COP4020 under a new supervisor: Dr. Beverly Sanders.

Advising Students
======
Office hours in this course were dedicating to advising students about their keystone project.

Debugging Students' Code
======
In this course's office hours, TAs helped students debug the keystone project code if their issues were not relevant to student learning.
I helped students debug issues that mostly had to do with misunderstanding the Java programming language used in this project.
