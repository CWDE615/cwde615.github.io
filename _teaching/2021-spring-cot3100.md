As my first experience teaching, I was a TA in the undergraduate discrete structures course at UF.
This was my first experience teaching and I enjoyed teaching this course to the point that I became a TA for it across several semesters.

Teaching Discussion Periods
======
For an hour each week, the other TAs and I were expected to teach an hour-long discussion period to review class material with the students.

Grading Exams
======
After each exam, the TAs split up the short-response and essay questions and graded them.
