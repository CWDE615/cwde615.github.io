As my first experience teaching, I was a TA in the undergraduate discrete structures course at UF.
I was a TA for this course for several semesters.
Below are just some of the responsibilities I saw to in this role.

Teaching Discussion Periods
======
For an hour each week, the other TAs and I were expected to teach an hour-long discussion period to review class material with the students.

Writing Exam Questions
======
I was asked to make several exam questions for the course under the instructors supervision.

Grading Exams
======
After each exam, the TAs split up the short-response and essay questions and graded them.
