In the Spring of 2022, I returned to being a TA for the undergrad Discrete Mathematics course at UF under Dr. Pete J. Dobbins.

Teaching Discussion Periods
======
For an hour each week, the other TAs and I were expected to teach an hour-long discussion period to review class material with the students.
In 2022, discussion periods moved back to the fact-to-face modality enjoyed before the COVID19 pandemic.

Writing Exam Questions
======
I was asked to make several exam questions for the course under the instructors supervision.

Grading Exams
======
After each exam, the TAs split up the short-response and essay questions and graded them.
